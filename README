WHAT IS DCC?

DCC is a C-like compiler used in linux. It contains 3 parts, which is dcc, dnasm, dld_s. Dcc is used to translate c-like language into nasm-like language(*.c => *.asm). Dnasm, is another component , which is for tranlating nasm-like language to machine code(*.asm => *.o). Dld_s, is a static linker, which links all the *.o into an executable file with the ELF format. So far, DCC is only for x86 platform.
